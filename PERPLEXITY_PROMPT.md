# Prompt for Perplexity

Find the official Zoho Mail documentation for programmatically sending emails from a backend server (VPS) using SMTP with an App Password. I specifically want to AVOID OAuth 2.0 complexity. Show me how to generate an Application-Specific Password in the Zoho Security settings and providing a Python `smtplib` example for sending HTML emails.
