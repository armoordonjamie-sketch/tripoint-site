## 1. Independent service

Tripoint Diagnostics Ltd ("we", "us", "our") is an independent mobile vehicle diagnostics and repair service. We are **not affiliated with, endorsed by, authorised by, or connected to any vehicle manufacturer**, including but not limited to Mercedes-Benz, Daimler Truck, Volkswagen Group, Ford, Stellantis, or any other brand.

References to vehicle makes, models, platforms, and engine codes (e.g., Mercedes Sprinter, Vito, OM651, OM654, W906, W907) are used for **descriptive purposes only** to indicate the types of vehicles we work on. These names are trademarks of their respective owners.

## 2. Diagnostic outcomes

### 2.1 Nature of diagnostic findings

Diagnostic findings represent our professional assessment based on the data, symptoms, live readings, and conditions available **at the time of the visit**. They are based on:

- Electronic control unit (ECU) fault code scans across all vehicle systems
- Freeze-frame data and stored event analysis
- Live data monitoring and sensor plausibility checks
- Guided tests and component actuations where appropriate
- Visual and operational inspection

### 2.2 Not a guarantee

Diagnostics identify the **most probable cause(s)** of a reported symptom or fault. They do not constitute:

- A guarantee that a specific repair will resolve the issue
- A guarantee that no further faults exist beyond those identified
- A complete mechanical or structural inspection of the vehicle
- An MOT assessment or roadworthiness certificate
- A vehicle valuation or purchase recommendation (even for pre-purchase health checks)

In complex or intermittent fault scenarios, further investigation, specialist testing, or a return visit may be recommended as part of our findings.

### 2.3 Pre-purchase health checks

Our Pre-Purchase Digital Health Check provides a diagnostic snapshot at the time of inspection. It is **not** a substitute for:

- A full mechanical inspection by a qualified inspector
- An HPI/provenance check
- An MOT history review
- An independent structural assessment

The check covers electronic system health, live data, and visible fault conditions. We do not inspect bodywork, structural integrity, tyres, brakes (beyond electronic data), or fluid condition unless specifically agreed.

## 3. Emissions compliance

### 3.1 Our position

Tripoint Diagnostics takes a strict, compliance-first stance on all emissions-related work. We **do not perform, advertise, recommend, or facilitate**:

- DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) removal, gutting, or physical deletion
- AdBlue / SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) system bypasses, emulators, or disabling
- EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) blanking, blocking, or software defeat
- Catalytic converter removal or bypass
- Any software modification, remap, or tuning file that disables, circumvents, or defeats emissions controls
- Installation, supply, or recommendation of defeat devices of any kind

### 3.2 Legal context

DPF removal is **almost always illegal** for road-registered vehicles in the UK. Under the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 (as amended), it is an offence to use a vehicle on the road that has been modified to not meet the emissions standards it was designed to comply with. Consequences include:

- MOT failure
- Fixed penalty notices
- Higher fines for light goods vehicles (vans)
- Potential insurance policy invalidation

(Source: GOV.UK guidance on vehicle emissions and exhaust systems)

### 3.3 ULEZ and Clean Air Zones

London's Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) operates 24/7 (except Christmas Day). Non-compliant vehicles under 3.5 tonnes are charged £12.50 per day. Other UK cities operate or are implementing Clean Air Zones with similar restrictions.

Our approach is to **diagnose and repair** emissions systems through proper procedures — not to bypass them. This protects you legally, keeps your vehicle compliant, and preserves its resale value.

## 4. Mobile service limitations

### 4.1 Location requirements

We operate as a mobile-only service. Work is carried out at the customer's location (driveway, depot, car park, yard, or similar). We reserve the right to decline or terminate a visit if the working environment is:

- On a live carriageway, hard shoulder, or red route
- On unstable, sloped, or uneven ground that is unsafe for jacking or supporting
- In an area with poor lighting, flooding, or severe weather
- In a restricted area where parking or working is not permitted
- Otherwise unsafe for the technician, the customer, or the public

### 4.2 Scope of mobile work

Some repairs are beyond the safe or practical scope of mobile work, including but not limited to:

- Jobs requiring vehicle lift/ramp access
- Transmission removal or internal engine work
- Work requiring specialist alignment, calibration, or programming equipment only available in a workshop
- Body, suspension, or structural repairs

Where we identify such a requirement, we will document our findings and refer you to an appropriate workshop with our diagnostic data and recommendations.
