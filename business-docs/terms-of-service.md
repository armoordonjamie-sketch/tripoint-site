## 3. Booking and deposits

### 3.1 How bookings work

1. You submit a booking request via our website or by contacting us directly.
2. We confirm availability and provide a quote based on your postcode (zone), service type, and vehicle.
3. A deposit is required to secure your booking slot.
4. Once the deposit is paid, your booking is confirmed and a calendar slot is reserved.

### 3.2 Deposit amounts

| Zone | Deposit |
|------|---------|
| Zone A (0–25 min drive) | £30 |
| Zone B (25–45 min drive) | £30 |
| Zone C (45–60 min drive) | £50 |

### 3.3 Payment methods

An invoice or receipt will be provided for every completed job, either by email or on request.

## 4. Cancellations and rescheduling

### 4.1 Customer cancellations

- **24+ hours' notice:** Reschedule free of charge — your deposit carries over to the new date.
- **Less than 24 hours' notice or no-show:** The deposit is retained to cover the reserved time slot and travel planning costs. No further charges apply.

### 4.2 Our cancellations

We reserve the right to cancel or reschedule a booking if:

- Weather or road conditions make travel unsafe
- The vehicle location is assessed as unsafe to work at (see Section 6)
- Unforeseen circumstances prevent us from attending

In these cases, we will offer a rescheduled appointment or a full deposit refund at your choice.

## 5. Pricing and additional charges

### 5.1 Published pricing

Our published prices cover the diagnostic visit and the included on-site time for each service tier. Current pricing is displayed at https://tripointdiagnostics.co.uk/pricing.

### 5.2 Follow-on work

If additional labour is needed beyond the included on-site time, it is charged at £85/hour, billed in 15-minute increments. This will be discussed and agreed with you before any additional work begins.

### 5.3 Parts

- Parts are charged separately from diagnostic/labour fees.
- Expensive components (e.g., NOx sensors, injectors) may require a parts deposit before ordering.
- We offer three options where applicable: OEM, OEM-equivalent, or customer-supplied.
- **Customer-supplied parts:** We will fit them at your request, but warranty coverage on the part itself is between you and the supplier. We warrant our labour only.
- Part numbers and supporting evidence (scan data, live readings) will be documented.

### 5.4 Coding and adaptations

Software coding, adaptations, or initialisations required as part of a repair are charged from £45, as detailed in our pricing page.

---

## 6. Service limitations and safety

### 6.1 Mobile-only boundaries

We operate exclusively as a mobile service. We may decline, rearrange, or terminate a job if:

- The vehicle is on a live road, unsafe roadside, or red route
- There is no safe, level ground to work on
- Poor lighting or weather makes working unsafe
- The repair requires ramp-level access or workshop-level equipment
- The location poses a risk to the technician or the public

### 6.2 Customer responsibilities

You are responsible for:

- Ensuring the vehicle is in a safe, accessible location (driveway, yard, depot, car park — **not** a live carriageway)
- Being available or reachable by phone during the appointment
- Providing accurate vehicle and symptom information at the time of booking
- Disclosing any known vehicle faults, modifications, or prior work relevant to the diagnosis

### 6.3 Workshop referral

If a fault requires workshop-level equipment, ramp access, or specialist tooling beyond the scope of mobile work, we will provide a documented referral with our findings and recommended next steps. This is included as part of our diagnostic service.

---

## 7. Diagnostic outcomes and liability

### 7.1 Nature of diagnostics

Diagnostic findings are based on the data, symptoms, and conditions available at the time of the visit. Diagnostics identify the most probable cause(s) based on:

- Full-system scans and fault code analysis
- Freeze-frame and live data interpretation
- Guided tests and actuations where appropriate
- Visual and operational checks

Diagnostics do **not** guarantee a specific repair outcome. In complex cases, further investigation, a return visit, or workshop-level diagnosis may be recommended.

### 7.2 Written outcomes

Every job concludes with a written outcome — findings, probable cause(s), and recommended next steps — delivered by email or via our diagnostic report system. This is your record and can be shared with other workshops if needed.

### 7.3 Limitation of liability

- Tripoint Diagnostics Ltd carries public liability and professional indemnity insurance.
- Our total liability for any claim arising from a service is limited to the value of the service fee paid for that visit.
- We are not liable for:
  - Pre-existing vehicle conditions discovered during diagnosis
  - Issues that develop after the visit that were not present or detectable at the time
  - Consequential losses, including but not limited to loss of earnings, vehicle hire costs, or ULEZ charges
  - Damage caused by customer-supplied parts or prior third-party work
  - Delays caused by parts availability from third-party suppliers

### 7.4 Insurance

We maintain appropriate insurance for our business activities, including:

- Public liability insurance
- Professional indemnity insurance
- Tools and equipment cover

Details of our cover can be provided on request.

## 8. Emissions compliance

Tripoint Diagnostics takes a strict compliance-first position on all emissions-related work.

**We do not perform, market, or facilitate:**

- DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) removal or physical deletion
- AdBlue / SCR system bypasses or disabling
- EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) blanking or defeat
- Any software modification that disables, circumvents, or defeats emissions controls

DPF removal is almost always illegal for road vehicles in the UK and can result in MOT failure and fines, including higher penalties for light goods vehicles (GOV.UK guidance).

All emissions-related work is carried out on a diagnosis-and-compliant-repair basis only. We verify repairs through proper procedures (forced regeneration, adaptation resets, live data confirmation).
