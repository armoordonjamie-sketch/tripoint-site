### Information collected automatically

- **Analytics:** We use privacy-friendly analytics (Plausible Analytics or similar) that do not use cookies, do not collect personal data, and do not track individuals across sites. No data is shared with third parties for advertising.
- **Server logs:** Our web server may record IP addresses, request timestamps, and user-agent strings for security and operational purposes. These logs are retained for a limited period and are not used for marketing.

### Information from third parties

- **Stripe:** When you make a payment, Stripe may provide us with transaction confirmation, payment status, and a customer reference. We do not receive your full card number.
- **Google Calendar:** If you book an appointment, we create a calendar event using Google Calendar API. This contains booking details (name, service, time, postcode) but no sensitive financial data.
