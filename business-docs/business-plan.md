Below is a complete business plan you can use as your “north star” and also hand to an accountant/insurer/partner. It’s written for a **mobile-only, diagnostics-first** side hustle with your **alternating shift pattern**, your **1-hour radius**, and your **compliance-first** positioning.

# Business Plan: TriPoint Diagnostics

## 1) Executive summary

**What you’re building**
A mobile, appointment-based diagnostics and repair service focused on modern diesel vans (especially Mercedes-Benz platforms you already know inside out) plus selective passenger-car diagnostic work. The core product is **certainty + speed of decision**: deep scan, guided tests where applicable, live data validation, and a **written fix plan**—with mobile repairs only where safe and feasible.

**Why it wins**

* **Market pain is urgent and expensive**: downtime for vans = lost earnings; misdiagnosis = repeated spend.
* **The market is saturated at the “cheap code read / mobile mechanic” layer**, but there’s clear space for “dealer-level depth, mobile convenience, and documented outcomes.”
* **Compliance-first is a margin lever**: you explicitly *don’t* offer deletes/defeat. DPF removal is “almost always illegal” per UK guidance and can lead to MOT failure and fines (including higher fines for light goods vehicles). ([GOV.UK][1])
* **ULEZ pressure** increases the cost of ignoring emissions issues for customers operating inside London (24/7 except Christmas Day, £12.50/day for vans ≤3.5t if non-compliant). ([Transport for London][2])
* **Security-related access is getting tighter**, and UK SERMI go-live is being reported as **1 April 2026**—raising the barrier for “cheap scanner” competition and making authorised workflows a clearer differentiator. ([rmif.co.uk][3])

**Targets (12 months)**

* 10–12 jobs/week average across your rota
* Build a pipeline where **GBP + referrals + partners** generate most leads (not PPC)
* Stabilise an average job value in the **£150–£220** range without becoming a general mobile mechanic

## 2) Business overview

### Mission

Keep working vehicles compliant, reliable, and earning—by delivering dealership-grade diagnostic thinking in a mobile format.

### Positioning statement

**“Compliance-first mobile diagnostics & repairs for modern diesel vans — dealer-level depth, written fix plans, no guesswork.”**

### Core differentiators

1. **Diagnostics-first (productised)**: every job ends with a written outcome.
2. **Commercial downtime focus**: VOR triage and depot-friendly hours (AM weeks).
3. **Mercedes van expertise**: W906/W907 + OM651/OM654 familiarity and correct procedures.
4. **Compliance-first**: you repair and verify—no delete marketing.

---

## 3) Market scope & service area

### Operating model

Mobile only, appointment-based, **max 60 minutes drive time** from the active base that week.

**Two bases (rotating):**

* PM weeks start from Tonbridge (TN9)
* AM weeks start from Eltham (SE9)

### Primary catchment (examples)

* Kent corridor: Sevenoaks, Maidstone, Tunbridge Wells
* SE London edge: Bromley, Bexley, Sidcup, Orpington
* Logistics pressure zone: Dartford, Gravesend
* London work pattern: Greenwich, Lewisham

(You don’t need to claim any one model is “dominant”; you win by owning the *symptoms + outcomes*.)

---

## 4) Customer segments

1. **Owner-driver couriers / sole traders (1 van)**
   Trigger: limp mode, warning lights, countdown/no-start risk.
   Buys: speed + clarity. Pays for urgency.

2. **SME fleets (5–20 vans)**
   Trigger: repeat faults, ULEZ/compliance pressure, downtime cost.
   Buys: dependable partner, documented repairs, predictable pricing.

3. **Van hire branches / local rental fleets**
   Trigger: a returned van with lights; off-hire time = lost revenue.
   Buys: triage and “rentable/not rentable” decision quickly.

4. **Private German-car owners (selective)**
   Trigger: intermittent faults, “already changed parts,” distrust of generalists.
   Buys: authority + documentation.

---

## 5) Services, pricing & product ladder

### Your published pricing (site-ready)

You already have this (zones A/B/C + three core products). Keep it unchanged for launch; tweak only after 30–50 completed jobs when you know your real travel time and overrun patterns.

**Why this pricing works**
It avoids the £60 “code read” race and anchors value to outcomes. It also keeps you near the UK consumer expectation that diagnostics aren’t “free” (and gives you room before VAT complexity becomes a factor).

### Product ladder (how you upsell without being pushy)

* Start: Diagnostic Callout (Standard)
* Upsell 1: Emissions Decision Visit (DPF/AdBlue/NOx/SCR) where relevant
* Upsell 2: VOR Priority dispatch where the customer is losing money
* Upsell 3: Follow-on repair slot **only if** safe and parts-ready
* Upsell 4: Fleet monthly scan sweep / “risk-ranked list” (repeat revenue)

---

## 6) Operations plan (built around your rota)

### Weekly schedule

* **Early-shift week at work (6–2)** → **TriPoint PM**
  Book 2 jobs/day + optional late diagnostic-only slot
* **Late-shift week at work (2–10)** → **TriPoint AM**
  Book 2 jobs/day (fleet/depot friendly)
* **Saturdays** every week → 2–3 jobs

This creates **12–13 available slots/week**, yielding **10–12 completed jobs/week** even with cancellations/overruns.

### Booking workflow (simple + repeatable)

1. Enquiry arrives (GBP / WhatsApp / referral / partner).
2. You request: reg, postcode, symptoms, drivability, warnings, where vehicle is parked.
3. You quote the **zone + product** and collect a **deposit to secure the slot**.
4. Pre-visit: confirm safe access + any part pre-order decision.
5. On-site: follow a consistent diagnostic script (below).
6. Customer leaves with: **written findings + next steps + quote**.

### Standard diagnostic script (your “process moat”)

* Verify complaint + quick visual/safety check
* Full-system scan and freeze frames
* Live data sanity checks (sensor plausibility)
* Guided tests / actuations where appropriate
* Confirm if fault is: sensor plausibility / wiring / mechanical / software/adaptation / emissions control
* Decide:

  * Fix now (mobile-feasible + safe + parts available), OR
  * Parts + return visit, OR
  * Workshop handoff with documented instructions

### Safety boundaries (non-negotiable)

* Decline unsafe roadside jobs (live carriageway, red routes, no lighting/space).
* No work requiring ramp-level access.
* Late slot = diagnostics-only unless the job is extremely contained and safe.

### Parts & supply chain policy

* Expensive items (e.g., NOx sensors): **deposit up front**.
* Give customers 3 options: OEM / OEM-equivalent / customer-supplied (with warranty caveat in writing).
* Always document part numbers and evidence supporting replacement (to reduce disputes).

---

## 7) Marketing & sales plan (no PPC-first)

### Primary lead engines

1. **Google Business Profile (GBP)**

   * Service-area business
   * Weekly photo uploads (tooling, screenshots, job process)
   * Review script that asks for “model + area” (no incentives)

2. **Symptom-led SEO pages (your highest ROI pages)**
   Build these in order:

   * “Sprinter Limp Mode Triage (Mobile)”
   * “AdBlue Countdown / Start Not Possible”
   * “NOx Sensor / SCR Efficiency Faults”
   * “DPF Regen Failed / Soot Load Too High”
   * “Mercedes Diagnostics & Coding (Mobile)”

3. **Partnership pipeline (highest-quality leads)**

   * Recovery operators
   * Van hire branches
   * Busy independents who don’t want deep diagnostic time sinks

**Partner pitch:** “I provide paid diagnosis + documentation. You keep the repair work.”

### Content that converts (and doesn’t feel cringe)

* 45–75s videos: “What the countdown means”, “Why a code read isn’t a diagnosis”, “What I check before a forced regen”
* Case logs (anonymised): symptom → tests → result
  This is how you out-rank generic competitors without ad spend.

### Minimal paid marketing (optional, later)

Only after you’ve got conversion dialled:

* small retargeting budget (site visitors)
* no broad “mobile mechanic” PPC keywords

---

## 8) Compliance, legal & risk

### Compliance stance (use this as a brand pillar)

* You do not market or perform emissions defeat.
* UK guidance is explicit that DPF removal is almost always illegal and can cause MOT failure and fines (including for light goods vehicles). ([GOV.UK][1])
* This protects you and wins fleets/insured operators who can’t accept the risk.

### ULEZ reality (how you use it without fear marketing)

London ULEZ runs 24/7 (except Christmas Day) and non-compliant vans ≤3.5t pay £12.50/day. ([Transport for London][2])
So your angle is: **“fix and verify” to keep them compliant and earning**.

### Data & record keeping

* Maintain job notes, screenshots, part numbers, and a simple PDF report template.
* This reduces “you just cleared codes” disputes and increases referrals.

### Business structure & tax (high-level)

* Plan for VAT early. The UK VAT registration threshold increased to **£90,000** from April 2024. ([GOV.UK][4])
  At 10–12 jobs/week, you may approach this—especially if you add repair labour/parts margin—so decide whether you aim to **stay under** or **price for VAT**.

Work with HMRC rules and get an accountant lined up from day 1.

### Insurance checklist (don’t skip)

* Public liability
* Professional indemnity (diagnostic advice)
* Tool cover
* Vehicle/business use insurance

### Regulatory access landscape

* Motor Vehicle block exemption in UK runs to **31 May 2029** (useful context for independent access, partnerships, and consumer trust). ([Legislation.gov.uk][5])
* UK SERMI go-live being reported as **1 April 2026**. ([rmif.co.uk][3])
  This supports your “authorised / secure-access ready” messaging and justifies premium pricing.

---

## 9) Financial plan (illustrative, adjust with your real costs)

### Revenue assumptions (base case)

* 10 jobs/week average
* 46 working weeks/year (allow holidays, sick, downtime)
* Average revenue per job (fees + common add-ons): **~£178**

**Projected annual revenue**

* 8 jobs/week: **~£65.5k**
* 10 jobs/week: **~£81.9k**
* 12 jobs/week: **~£98.3k**

### Cost model (example placeholders)

**Variable per job**

* Fuel/parking/consumables: ~£20–£25/job
* Card fees: ~1–2% of revenue

**Fixed annual**

* Tool subscriptions (Xentry/diag/tuning): £X
* Insurance: £X
* Phone/software/accounting: £X
* Van costs/maintenance: £X

Using a typical mixed-cost model (moderate fixed costs + ~£21/job variable + ~1.5% card fees), the **pre-tax profit can be strong**—but the real lever is **time discipline** and **avoiding travel waste**, not squeezing pennies.

### Break-even thinking (what matters)

Your real break-even is not “money”, it’s **hours**:

* If travel + overrun makes you miss slots, your weekly capacity collapses.
* That’s why zone rules + deposits + boundaries are non-negotiable.

---

## 10) KPIs (track weekly)

**Lead & conversion**

* Leads by channel (GBP / partner / repeat / SEO / social)
* Booking conversion rate
* Deposit-to-show rate

**Operations**

* Average drive time per job
* % jobs completed within slot
* Revisit rate (should drop as your process tightens)

**Commercial**

* Average job value
* % VOR/Emissions jobs (higher margin)
* Reviews per week (aim 2–3 early on)

---

## 11) Milestones & timeline

### Days 0–30: Launch credibility + conversion

* Landing page + pricing + “boundaries” page + sample report PDF
* GBP live, fully optimised
* 10 reviews target
* 10 partner outreaches (recoveries/hire/garages)

### Days 31–60: Build your symptom SEO engine

* Publish the 5 symptom pages
* Post 1 case log per week
* Secure 2 partner relationships that send leads

### Days 61–90: Add repeatable revenue

* Fleet scan sweep product
* Simple CRM + templates
* Tighten zone C limits and “slot discipline”

### 6–12 months: Defensive moat

* Build a “case library” (anonymised)
* Partner network becomes primary lead source
* Decide VAT strategy before you accidentally cross it

---

## 12) Risk register (and how you mitigate)

1. **Diary destroyed by travel** → zone limits + slot rules + no sandwiching far jobs
2. **Customers want “cheap code read”** → publish pricing + outcomes; don’t negotiate down
3. **Parts delays** → deposits + clear lead time comms + customer-supply option
4. **Unsafe locations** → strict safety policy, refuse politely, offer tow/relocate option
5. **Competition undercutting** → compete on documented outcomes + compliance + speed
6. **Tool access/security changes** → stay subscription-current; position as secure-access ready (SERMI context) ([rmif.co.uk][3])
