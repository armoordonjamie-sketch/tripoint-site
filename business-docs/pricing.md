---

## 6) Mobile-only boundaries (safety & feasibility)

I’m mobile-only and will only work where it’s safe and practical. I may decline or rearrange a job if:

* Vehicle is on a live road / unsafe roadside / red route
* No safe space to jack/support the vehicle
* Poor lighting/ground conditions for the work required
* The job requires ramp-level access or workshop equipment

**Repairs I’ll commonly do mobile (when safe):**

* Diagnostic work, inspections, sensor and wiring investigations
* Battery/charging issues, minor electrical faults
* Servicing (oil/filters) with confirmed spec/quantity
* Brakes (pads/discs) where access and conditions allow

**Repairs that often require workshop referral:**

* Work needing a ramp or major underbody access
* Heavy drivetrain jobs that can’t be done safely mobile
* Anything that can’t be verified properly on-site

---

## 7) Parts policy (avoids delays and misunderstandings)

* Expensive parts (e.g., NOx sensors) may require **parts deposit upfront**
* You can choose: **OEM / OEM-equivalent / customer-supplied**
* If you supply parts yourself, I’ll explain warranty terms clearly before ordering

---

## 8) Payment & invoices

* Payment due **on completion of the visit** (or as agreed for parts deposits)
* Invoice/receipt provided
* **VAT:** if applicable, it will be clearly shown on the invoice

---

## 9) How to book (fastest way)

Send on WhatsApp/text:

* Postcode + registration
* Vehicle make/model + mileage
* Symptoms + warning lights
* Is it **drivable** or **VOR**?
* Where it’s parked (driveway/yard etc.)

I’ll confirm:

* Zone (A/B/C)
* Price
* Next available slot
* Deposit link/details
